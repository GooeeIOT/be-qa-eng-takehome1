# General Instructions

See [problem1](problem1/) and [problem2](problem2/).

We expect these solutions to be **in Python** and pushed within a few hours (based on timestamp of commits) of when they were given out. Code should ideally be clear, commented, and _some_ thought given to edge cases. 

Ideally, you'll:

* `git clone` this git repo
* create a branch of master
* `git commit` and `git push` as you work through the problem 
* submit a pull request for your branch against master
* the team will review when we can
 
If making a PR etc for what ever reason can't be accomplished, just submit the files zipped to your recruiter or Gooee contact directly.
